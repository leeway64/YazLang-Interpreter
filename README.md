# YazLang Interpreter

This project created an interpreter for the programming language YazLang. YazLang is an extremely simple programming language created by Ayaz Latif, a Computer Science instructor at the University of Washington Seattle.

I would like to give credit to the UWS CSE 142 summer 2020 course website for providing the specifications for this project. The specifications can be found here: [CSE 142 HW page](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse142/20su/homework.html#a6). The original assignment was meant to be written in Java, but I completed the assignment using C++.
